# üîß Deployment Fixes Applied

This document tracks fixes applied to make the application work on Render.

## Fix #1: Network Error During Registration

**Issue:** Users were getting "Network error during registration" when trying to create accounts on the deployed app.

**Root Cause:**
- The client code was using `import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL || 'http://localhost:5000/api'`
- Since `VITE_API_URL` was not defined, it defaulted to `localhost:5000`
- This caused the deployed frontend to try calling `localhost:5000` instead of the actual backend

**Solution:**
Changed from absolute URLs to relative URLs since the frontend and backend are served together:

### Files Changed:

**`client/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`:**
- Line 65: Changed from `${API_URL}/auth/me` to `/api/auth/me`
- Line 106: Changed from `${API_URL}/auth/signup` to `/api/auth/signup`

**Why this works:**
- When frontend and backend are on the same server (Render deployment), relative URLs automatically point to the correct server
- No need for environment variables to configure API URL
- Works in both development (Vite proxy) and production (same server)

---

## Testing

### Before Deploying:
```bash
# Test locally
npm run dev

# Test production build
npm run build
npm start
# Visit http://localhost:5000 and test signup
```

### After Deploying:
1. Visit your Render URL
2. Try creating a new account
3. Check browser console for errors (should be none)
4. Check Render logs for successful API calls

---

## Future Deployment Issues?

If you encounter other network errors:

1. **Check Browser Console:**
   - Look for failed network requests
   - Note the URL being called (should be `/api/...` not `localhost`)

2. **Check Render Logs:**
   - Go to Render Dashboard ‚Üí Your Service ‚Üí Logs
   - Look for API endpoint errors
   - Check for missing environment variables

3. **Verify Environment Variables:**
   - All required variables set in Render dashboard
   - No typos in variable names
   - Values are correct (especially Supabase keys)

4. **Test API Endpoints:**
   ```bash
   # From your browser console on the deployed site:
   fetch('/api/auth/me').then(r => r.json()).then(console.log)
   ```
